      <div class="experience">
        <h3>IBM — Software Developer Trainee</h3>
        <p><em>ASP.NET · Frontend · Scrum · Databases</em></p>

        My first internship was at IBM, where I developed internal company projects in ASP/.NET, front-end
        development using SenchaJS, and also served as a Scrum Master and handled basic database management
        (among other things).
        This experience taught me many important lessons about the structure of work in large-scale companies.
        It also taught me how to work with high-value clients and how to reach agreements diplomatically.

        <ul>
          <li>Development of internal projects using ASP.NET and SenchaJS.</li>
          <li>Active role as Scrum Master in agile teams.</li>
          <li>Direct interaction with high-value clients, strengthening communication skills.</li>
          <li>Experience in large-scale corporate structures.</li>

        <h3>Vida Security (IBM Consulting) — Frontend Developer</h3>
        <p><em>Business Systems / Maintenance</em></p>

        My second internship was at Vida Security as an IBM representative through the consulting team.
        There, I performed Front-End maintenance on an insurance and policies application.
        I learned to manage complex legacy systems, where I had to quickly adapt to a massive codebase
        with sparse documentation.

        <ul>
          <li>Mantenimiento y mejora de aplicación de pólizas y seguros.</li>
          <li>Trabajo con sistemas monolíticos legacy y baja documentación.</li>
          <li>Alta capacidad de adaptación a entornos complejos.</li>

        <h3>MatchaFunding — Product Owner & Backend / DevOps</h3>
        <p><em>University project awarded for innovation</em></p>

        MatchaFunding was an initiative among several university classmates, where I took on the roles of Product Owner, Back-End Developer,
        and DevOps Engineer. This experience helped me develop a wide range of hard and soft skills. I learned to define projects based on
        real needs, assign tasks, assess risks, and work effectively in a team. This project encompassed a variety of technologies, and was
        developed with a microservices model in mind.

        I primarily worked in Python, initially using Django as a Back-End Framework, FastAPI for microservices, Transformers for
        AI / Machine Learning, Selenium for Web-Scraping, MySQL for the Database and ReactJS with TypeScript for the Front-End.

		    The project was awarded the innovation prize by the external jury (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matchafunding_muy-felices-de-anunciar-que-el-d%C3%ADa-de-ayer-activity-7395090761928679424-MBAu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAD8MEbYBBBWso7eAuELTpuA6Jsf6WWT1uu0">LinkedIn Post</a>)

      <h2>Featured Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ElMaikina/http-in-c">Back-End in C:</a></strong>
          Back-end built from scratch in C as an exercise to understand in depth the different components
          required on the server side.

          This project uses the HTTP server via libmicrohttpd, connects to MySQL to store data,
          uses Redis as a cache, and parses I/O with cJSON.

          It was initially created as an exercise to better understand the different components of an HTTP server;

          however, the project is designed to be extensible if you wish to use it as a base.
        </li>

        <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ElMaikina/platformer">Videogame in C:</a></strong>
          A simple video game built from scratch in C.
          The engine includes physics for 2D objects, character control via keyboard,
          a system for creating and loading levels using CSVs, objects with unique physics,
          and basic rendering optimization.
        </li>

        <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ElMaikina/calendar">Google Calendar:</a></strong>
          A Python program to view my pending tasks based on activities and events in Google Calendar using OAuth2.
          The pending tasks are exported to a Markdown file based on their proximity and other relevant parameters.
        </li>

        <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ElMaikina/spotify-to-txt">Spotify to TXT:</a></strong>
          A Python program to export Spotify "Albums", "Playlists", and "Likes".

          The collections are then saved to a plain text file with the corresponding name, which
          will contain all the songs separated by line breaks.

          The program runs parallel processes for each type of collection searched.
        </li>

        <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ElMaikina/utfsm-oop">OOP and AI:</a></strong>
          Repository with assignments for the elective course "Object-Oriented Programming".

          It primarily contains terminal applications written in Java and C++ to implement "OOP", but
          JavaFX and Qt are also used for some assignments.

          The course had a final project of my choosing, in which I created a creature simulator using "Machine Learning"        
          and "OOP" in Python. Each creature is born with a random personality, where they can interact and engage in
          dialogue.
        </li>

        <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ElMaikina/http-in-c">Vehicle Maintenance in Spring Boot:</a></strong>
          A simple vehicle maintenance management application for a transportation company.

          Developed as a freelance project, this application is intended to be integrated into an internal website.

          The program uses Spring Boot, JPA, Jakarta, and MariaDB. It employs the most common conventions in the industry.

          It is eventually intended to be part of a mobile application.
